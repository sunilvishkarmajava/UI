              <p>Things still don’t look quite right. I added the borders around each paragraph
so you can see an important characteristic of floating elements. Even
though the text of paragraph 3 wraps to the right of paragraph 2, the actual
paragraph element still extends all the way to the left side of the page. The
element doesn’t necessarily flow around the floated element, but its contents
do. The background color and border of paragraph 3 still take as much
space as they normally would if paragraph 2 didn’t exist.
